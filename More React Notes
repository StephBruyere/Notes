React has the concept of a virtual dom, serves as an intermediary dom server to minimize to amount of changes pushed to the browser for performance. 
React does not support Ajax. 
Common.js is a module loader. 

All code inserted in react should be populated in to your root containder (example) <div class = "root">
Webpack- gives all files a name of bundle.js (combines all files in to one file);

You can only have one single node per component for react files (example, one file for a nav bar, one for jumbotron)

### Create your React Element
Const title = React.createElement (
'H1' //tag to be created
{Id:'title', className: 'header'}, // add attributes
)

### Render to the DOM
ReactDOM.render(
  title, 
  document.getElementById ("react-container")
  )
 
//you can also remove render and create element by declaring them globally.
Const {createElement} = React
Const {render} = ReactDOM
